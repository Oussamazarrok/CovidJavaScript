# CovidJavaScript
Hello.
Since Cornona Virus Pandemic came to this world, the total Cases and the total of deaths have increased.
So a bunch of free APIs are came to calculate the amount of numbers of deaths and recoveries.
That's why i came a accross an Idea to use those APIs and show them in my Web Page using JavaScript and Metro UI Css as one of the new CSS Frameworks that got my intention for a while.
If you want to run the whole project insatll the Rar file or you can just see the both JavaScript files and CSS to see what i did using some tutoriels.
